# Mariam Ayman — AI Engineer in Training

## About Me
I am Mariam Ayman, an AI Engineer at the beginning of my journey.  
I started by learning Python and data analysis libraries, then moved on to Scikit-learn to build simple machine learning models.

## Skills I've Learned So Far
- **Python Programming**: foundation for coding and data analysis.
- **Data Analysis Libraries**:
  - NumPy: numerical computations and arrays.
  - Pandas: data cleaning and manipulation.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: data visualization and plotting.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Scikit-learn: building models such as classification and regression.

## Current Focus
- Applying small projects using Scikit-learn.
- Exploring datasets and experimenting with different algorithms.
- Understanding the machine learning pipeline (data cleaning → model training → evaluation).

## Next Steps
- Deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.
- Participating in Kaggle competitions to apply skills in real-world scenarios.
